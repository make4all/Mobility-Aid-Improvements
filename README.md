# Mobility Aid Improvements
## Modular Cane
This prototype was mainly used to explore the design space and is not intended to be used as weight loading parts without additional post-processing (e.g., electroplating).

Handles were created to fit onto an aluminum pipe with an outer diameter of 3/4". We choose to use a wall thickness of 0.065" as a balance between strength and weight. If using an FDM printer, take care to print such that the orientation of force put onto the handle tubing does not align with the force used for normal movement. Two of the handles, we remixed from existing designs:
- thingiverse.com/thing:2951701
- myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-150346

To adjust the height, we used PVC couplers to attach different lengths of tubing. However, we would not recommend their usage in real-world scenarios as they introduced instability when placing significant weight on them. We would recommend getting additional piece of aluminum piping that is prethreaded and using that a height adjuster for everyday usage.

For the tips, any replacement cane tip for 3/4" cane diameters should work. We specifically used these four:

- amazon.com/dp/B09KBRZKQ2
- amazon.com/dp/B00LGDVSC4

## Kerfing pattern
We have attached the kerf pattern that we used. If engraved decorations are wanted, simply overlay an SVG on top of it and set the design to be raster engraved.
